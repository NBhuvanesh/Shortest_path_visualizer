# Shortest_path_visualizer
Computes the shortest path between two points using dijkshika's algorithm
# Start-Node
This node is the starting point from where the the travel should start
# walls
 Walls can be added to block the path so that those nodes are not considered while calculating the shortest path
 # end node
 This is the dstination node.
